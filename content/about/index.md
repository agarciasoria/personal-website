My name is Alejandro, and I am a physicist and educator with a passion for understanding the fundamental laws of the universe and sharing that knowledge with others.

## My Journey

My academic path began with bachelor's degrees in both Mathematics and Physics, where I developed a strong foundation in analytical and quantitative reasoning. This dual focus allowed me to appreciate both the abstract beauty of mathematical structures and their concrete applications in the physical world.

Driven by a desire to explore the deeper questions of reality, I pursued a Master's degree in Theoretical Physics. My research focused primarly on the AdS/CFT correspondence, particularly on how we can use higher-derivative gravities to study hydrodynamic and thermodynamic properties of strongly-coupled plasmas.

## My Philosophy on Education

Beyond research, I am deeply committed to education. I completed a Master's in Educational Training to learn how to effectively translate complex scientific concepts for diverse audiences. I believe that science should be accessible and inspiring to everyone.
